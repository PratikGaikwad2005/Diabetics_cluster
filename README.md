🧪 Diabetes Patient Clustering with K-Means

This project applies K-Means clustering on a diabetes dataset to group patients based on Glucose and BMI levels. The goal is to identify meaningful patient segments that can help in risk profiling and healthcare decision-making.

🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values in the dataset.

K-Means Clustering: Automatically groups patients into 3 clusters.

Centroid Calculation: Identifies the “average patient” for each cluster.

Visualization: Scatter plots (Glucose vs BMI) with clusters highlighted in different colors and centroids marked as larger points.

Integration with Power BI: Enables interactive dashboards where clusters and centroids can be visualized dynamically.

📊 Insights from Clustering

Patients with high Glucose + high BMI → high-risk cluster.

Patients with low Glucose + normal BMI → low-risk cluster.

Patients with moderate levels fall into intermediate clusters.

This helps doctors, researchers, and analysts understand patient distribution and target preventive care strategies.
